Journalist: Tobey, it's great to have you here today. How are you doing?

Tobey Maguire: Hi there, thanks for having me. I'm doing great, thanks for asking.

Journalist: So Tobey, the internet is buzzing with rumors that you'll be returning as Spider-Man in the upcoming "Spider-Man: No Way Home" movie. Can you confirm or deny these rumors?

Tobey Maguire: Sorry, I can't confirm or deny anything at this time.

Journalist: Hmm, well can you tell us anything about the movie at all?

Tobey Maguire: Well, as you know, Marvel is known for keeping things under wraps until the movie's release. So I can't say much, but I can tell you that it's going to be a really exciting movie.

Journalist: Okay, fair enough. Let's talk about some of your other projects. You recently starred in "The Card Counter" alongside Oscar Isaac. What was that experience like?

Tobey Maguire: It was great working with Oscar and director Paul Schrader. I loved the script and the character I got to play. It was a very intense and emotional film to make, but I'm really proud of how it turned out.

Journalist: You've also been producing lately. What drew you to producing?

Tobey Maguire: I've always been interested in the filmmaking process beyond just acting. Producing allows me to have more creative control and input in a project, from the script to the final product. It's a challenging but rewarding role.

Journalist: What projects are you currently working on as a producer?

Tobey Maguire: I have a few projects in the works, but I can't reveal too much about them just yet. But I can say that they're all very different from each other, and I'm excited to see them come to life.

Journalist: That sounds intriguing. Lastly, I have to ask - what's your favorite Spider-Man movie?

Tobey Maguire: (laughs) That's a tough one. Each of the Spider-Man movies I was a part of had their own unique qualities, and I'm proud of each of them in their own way. But if I had to pick one, I would say the first Spider-Man movie that Sam Raimi directed. It was such a groundbreaking film at the time, and it was an honor to be a part of it.

Journalist: Well, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us today, Tobey. Best of luck with all your upcoming projects.

Tobey Maguire: Thank you, it was my pleasure.
